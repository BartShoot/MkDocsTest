## Preparing the board for installation

Insert M4x10 screws into the 4.5 mm holes in the MDF board and screw M4 hammer nuts on them (by two turns)

Align every hammer nut parallelly to the edge of the MDF board, so you can slide the v-slot extrusions of the assembled frame on them

Slide the T-nut inside the 388-mm v-slot extrusions to their ends, as shown on the picture.

## Installing MDF board

Carefully place the MDF board on the frame in a way that all of the M4 hammer nuts are fitting inside the extrusion slots

Align the edges of the MDF board with the frame on all sides

!!! note "Keep in mind"
    While tightening the MDF, make sure that hammer nuts get locked inside the v-slots! A recommended way is to turn the M4 screw anti-clockwise first, then fasten - there is a high probability that this will lock the nut inside the extrusion.

!!! warning "Warning"
    Tighten all screws so the MDF board is firmly attached to the frame.
