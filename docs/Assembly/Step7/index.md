## Y-axis mount assembly
Prepare two Y-axis mounting components

![X axis assembly](resources/step7.1.webp)

Push four LM12UU linear bearings in Y1 and Y2 components. Place the bearings in a way that the ball lines are rotated approximately 45° relative to each other.

Unscrew the trapezoid nuts from the Y-axis motors and place them inside the pockets in the Y-axis mounting component

Fasten the nuts to both components using four M3x25 bolts

## Installation of Y-axis extrusion and linear rods
Prepare the 2040 v-slot extrusion (with a yellow warning label)

![X axis assembly](resources/step7.11.webp)

Slide the 2040 v-slot extrusion in the Y2 component and fasten using two M5x35 bolts.

![X axis assembly](resources/step7.14.webp)
![X axis assembly](resources/step7.15.webp)

Push two 12 mm linear rods (400 mm long) in the pockets — make sure they reach the bottom

![X axis assembly](resources/step7.17.webp)

Take the CX-80 lithium grease, squeeze some inside every bearing and spread across the whole inside surface using an Allen key

![X axis assembly](resources/step7.18.webp)
![X axis assembly](resources/step7.19.webp)

Slide the X-module assembled in STEP 6 on the X-axis rods and check if it moves smoothly. If not, repeat the greasing.

![X axis assembly](resources/step7.21.webp)

Slide the other part of Y-axis, (Y1) on the rods and the extrusion and push so the extrusion reaches the end of the pocket

![X axis assembly](resources/step7.22.webp)
![X axis assembly](resources/step7.23.webp)

Fasten the extrusion to Y1 component using M5x40 bolts

## Mounting X-axis motor
Slide the X-axis motor in and turn the screw so it reaches ca. 60 mm above the trapezoid nut in the Z-module

![X axis assembly](resources/step7.26.webp)
![X axis assembly](resources/step7.27.webp)

Slide the Z-module to make the trapezoid screw sit in the bearing and motor reach the bottom of the pocket.

![X axis assembly](resources/step7.28.webp)
![X axis assembly](resources/step7.29.webp)

Fasten the motor using four M3x25 bolts
