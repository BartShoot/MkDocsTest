# Step 8 - Mounting the X-axis on the frame

!!! info "Required elements"
    - T-Nuts
    - M3x10 screws
    - M5x10 screws
    - M5x12 screws
    - CX-80 lithium grease
    - 608ZZ ball bearing
    - Trapezoid nut

## Installation of motor mounts to the frame
Slide two T-nuts in each of the left and right slots of the 570 mm extrusions and one in each of the upper slots (on both sides)

## Preparation of Y endstop and emergency stop mount
Slide one T-nut in each of the left slots of the left v-slot extrusion — these will be used to mount the Y-axis endstop

## X and Y axis assembly
Grease the linear bearings sitting in the Y1 and Y2 parts and slide the 12 mm linear rods in them

Slide the Y-axis motors with trapezoid screws through the motor mounts by around 150 mm, turning them at the same time and screwing into the nuts in Y1 and Y2 components

!!! danger "Warning"
    Make sure that the trapezoid screws are screwed in by the same distance

Move the X-axis so the ends of trapezoid screws get into the front-mounted 608ZZ ball bearings and stepper motors are positioned inside the mounts
